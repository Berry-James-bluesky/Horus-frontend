_A simple `<NavLink />` based component used for navigating 'Horus'_

### Props:
`link: string` = Relative path to navigate to (i.e. /settings)

`iconName: string` = The name of the FontAwesome icon to be displayed in the notification (reference list of available icons at https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/icon/ )

`label: string` = Text to be shown for the link

`react-router-dom` `<NavLink />` components automatically have an `activeClassName` property, which assigns it the passed classes only when that particular link is active.
